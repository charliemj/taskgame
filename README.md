I'm trying to make a lightweight version of something similar to [habitica](https://habitica.com/static/front). Basically, this app should help a user outline tasks they need to do and when they complete the task, they get a certain number of points. They can add rewards and associate them with a cost. Once the user has gained enough points, they can spend them on rewards.
